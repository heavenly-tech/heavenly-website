## Logo Processing for Printing
[sc.estudio](https://instagram.com/sc.estudio)'s logo was already in a digital format, however, it was still required to process it in order to 3D print a product from it. This consists of:

- Vectorising the image

- Exporting it to a CAD-compatible format (Autodesk Inventor)

- Produce the 3D model of the desired product

- Prepare the 3D model for 3D printing (slicing)

By the end of this process, it is possible to preview the printing procedure and the end result.

#### Figurine design

To display the logo it was given some thickness and a base to place it. The logo by itself however is unstable, so the base was extended as a projected shadow. This need is two-fold, as it also gives a more orderly exhibit. It is now on display at the reception of the beauty studio.
