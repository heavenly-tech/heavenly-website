To get setup duly in our new office, we designed our own logo display for outside our entrance. It was fully printed in-house.

The mounting points already existed prior to our arrival. We decided to print something that would mount on these, in order to re-use them and be minimally invasive. As the area covered is large, the logo display had to be printed in several parts, including the large background and __heavenly__ text. CAD was used to turn our graphic to a printable product and produce a digital preview. We would like to share our process and results with you.
